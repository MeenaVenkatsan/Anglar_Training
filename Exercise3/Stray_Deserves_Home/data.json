I fed but didnt have heart to seperate him from his mom as he was playing and jumping all around her. But as the days goes his inquiry got worse and people started to hit him as he surrounded by fleas. So me and my brother took him in and taken to vet. The poor little one lost his two fingers and his entire paw is mishaped and had wounded stomach. Still mesmerised knowing even through all these pain he managed to play and jump with his mother. Now he is all cured and growing like hulk in our home."

Later days my brother joined and treated her eyes and other wounds. My mom named her sneha and fed her whenever she could especially when she is pregnant and after giving birth. Little effort from us gave her ability to survive among other dogs   "
